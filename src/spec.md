## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current Rose Day greeting page with a professional, interactive informational website about “Heart Disease Classification From Echocardiogram Images Using Deep Learning”, including clear credit to MUHAMMAD RAOOF and MUHAMMAD MAHTAB and a custom “Sonu & Kuldeep” brand/logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all Rose Day content, romantic styling, and rose/petal imagery; replace with English medical/AI-themed content focused on echocardiogram-based heart disease classification.
- Implement a consistent professional healthcare/AI visual theme (colors, typography, layout, buttons, backgrounds, and interactive states).
- Add a sticky top navigation with smooth-scroll to page sections.
- Add at least two interactive content patterns (e.g., tabs for “Pipeline / Model / Results” and an accordion FAQ), with keyboard operability and clear focus states.
- Add a custom “Sonu & Kuldeep” logo and use it in the site header and as the favicon/app icon.
- Update document metadata (HTML title and visible branding) to reflect the new topic/brand and remove any Rose Day naming.
- Add and reference new static generated images from `frontend/public/assets/generated` for hero/illustrations/backgrounds; ensure old rose/petal images are not used.
- Ensure responsive layout and accessibility (readable contrast, mobile-friendly spacing, no overflow, visible focus styling).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate an English, responsive, and accessible informational website about echocardiogram-based heart disease classification, with smooth section navigation, interactive content areas, credited authors, and “Sonu & Kuldeep” branding including a custom logo and favicon.
