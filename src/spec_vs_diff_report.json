  "summary": "The diff largely replaces the Rose Day UI with a new single-page medical/AI themed informational site, adds a sticky smooth-scroll header, and includes two interactive patterns (tabs + accordion). Metadata and theming were updated. However, the required generated image assets themselves are not evidenced as added, and the requirement that the custom logo image includes the names “Sonu” and “Kuldeep” cannot be verified from code-only diffs.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Add and use new generated static images for the new topic (hero/illustrations/backgrounds) from frontend/public/assets/generated, and ensure the UI references these new assets (do not fetch images from the backend).",
      "reason": "The UI references files under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not show any new image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (only TSX/CSS/HTML/JS changes are shown). Without evidence of the actual asset files being added, the requirement is not fully satisfied.",

      "reason": "Header and favicon are wired to logo paths, but the diff does not include the actual logo image content. From code alone, it cannot be verified that the image mark itself contains the names “Sonu” and “Kuldeep” as part of the visual logo.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on replacing the Rose Day page with a medical/AI informational site. The diff shows these Rose Day components still exist and were modified, which is extra/unrequested work unless they are completely unused/removed from the new UI (not verifiable from the diff summary).",
